            <span className>First impressions mean everything in business and good website design is the key to exploiting this. 
In my opinion, a great site is not measured by looks alone, but also by functionality and usability.

I am an experienced programmer who can find creative solutions to technical challenges, whilst at the same time designing a clean and visually appealing websites. I have knowledge of recognised technical standards and I am familiar with modern build practices.

Aside from my technical competencies, on a personal level, I also have a talent for building good relationships with my team. I possess the communication skills needed to get the best out of others and to get everyone pushing in the same direction.

Right now I am keen to work for a company like yours where I will have an opportunity to work with the brightest and the best in the field of web design.

I will be looking forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,
George Misan.</span>
